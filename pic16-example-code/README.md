PIC Example Code
================

I have written some example code for the PIC16F57 chip. This code should turn all registers on `PORTB` into output mode. Similarly, all the associated pins should be driven high with the exception of the pin associated with `RB4`.

Similarly, it configures the chip such that it will run in RC oscillator mode with the watchdog timer and code protection disabled.
